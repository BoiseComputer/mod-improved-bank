Gossip NPC that allows player to deposit an infinite number of items and then withdraw them later. The bank can be configured to be account-wide. There is also a menu (configurable) that allows the player to quickly deposit all reagents.

## How to install

Simply clone the repository and add mod-improved-bank to the modules folder. Re-run cmake and rebuild the project. The .sql files should be imported automatically, if not then you should manually apply them.
